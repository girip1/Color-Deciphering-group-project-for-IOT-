# Color-Deciphering-group-project-for-IOT-
Color detection, basic color theory and the applications of color sensor is shown throughout this project. The values can be adjusted to recognize colors. The value of distance controls the motor rotation so that can also be adjusted according to project. If the color sensor sees red, the LED will turn red. If it sees blue, the LED will turn blue. Our challenge in this project is to make the sensor match as many colors as well as possible. We used the Arduino, breadboard, and RGB LED we have been so far. The good news is the components were affordable. To connect the color sensor to Arduino we needed some connecting jumper wires. Here, in this project, instead of getting the desired color from the user via the serial port, we will set the LED color by having it match colored M&Mâ€™s by placing in front of the sensor. So, then we would need to figure out how to operate the sensor.
